# bangla-signlanguage-translator
A real-time Bangla Sign Language translator built with MediaPipe, PyQt6, and deep learning. It extracts hand and body keypoints from live video, records and visualizes sign data, trains an LSTM model, and converts continuous BSL gestures into readable text subtitles through an interactive GUI.
